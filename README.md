# Retrieve-Courses Title: Retrieve Courses from Cognomos API  

This repo contains a Python script to retrieve courses from the Cognomos API.

The script takes two arguments: an authentication token and a run slug. It then makes a series of API requests to retrieve the courses associated with the run slug, and saves the results as a CSV file. 

Languages used: Python 

Data retrieved can be used by students using Cognomos's CourseMatch registration system (i.e. https://students.business.columbia.edu/records-registration/course-match-registration)
